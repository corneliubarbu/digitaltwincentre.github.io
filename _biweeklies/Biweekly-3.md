## Pre-meeting stakeholder's reports

<!-- Please keep in mind that the minutes are publicly available, and that
private information must be stored elsewhere.  -->

#### Peter Gorm Larsen
* Christian Leegard and Hugo Macedo have now been able to create a small device that can extract the data from the Line Following Robot (LFR) wireless in real time. I expect that we will use this to do our first digital twin experiments using teh LFR case. 
* Evaluation of Jim Woodcock is now complete. Expect contract in place soon.
* I have met with representatives from "Aarhus School of Marine and Technical Engineering" and they are interested in collaboration with us in getting a digital twin constructed for some of the large equipmenbt they use in an educational setting.
* Casper Thule will be defending his PhD on the 10th of September
* I will meet with the Poul Due Jensen Foundation on the 12th of September

#### Nick Battle
* The VDM-SL model of the static semantics of the FMI Standard is more or less complete, though whether it is correct remains an open question.
* A VDMCheck tool, encapsulating the model and allowing "general use", is available to analyse FMUs.
* The tool has been executed over the 692 FMUs in the Cross-Check repository, revealing that only 42% of them are error-free (according to the VDM model - or 77% according to the existing compliance checker).
* A small amount of modelling work started to define the static semantics of a collection of FMUs (converting Maestro JSON configurations to VDM-SL), defing the meaning of algebraic loops and the required order of initialization processing.
* Started work on the outline of a VDM-SL model for the dynamic (API) semantics of the standard.
* Some slides for the Overture Workshop drafted.

#### Hugo 
* Sorted out problem with biweeklies editing permissions and member invitations. All should be able to edit now. Contact me in case you have trouble with this.  
* Will substitue Mikkel in the presentation of the INTO-CPS cloud app for the Overture workshop. Looking forward to meet there and launch further projects/joint paper writting.
* Is exploring cloud hosting solutions for the app and cloud based co-simulation.
* Working towards the LFR digital twin case study. 

#### Jim Woodcock
* Waiting for contract from Aarhus.
* Sent digested agenda for foundational research to PGL.
* Gave a talk on past and future grand challenges in computer science at a workshop in Newcastle. Suggested V&V of autonomous vehicles and digital twins as future grand challenges. Talk was well received, particularly by the head of ICT at EPSRC (UK funding council).

#### Casper Thule
* Back at AU preparing PhD Defense
* Create website that will host utility tools - hosts VDMCheck

#### Claudio Gomes
* Finished draft of paper for american modelica conference. Waiting some results from Kenneth et. al.
* Just defense thesis. 
* Will apply for aarhus position soon.
* Will ask Casper to also host the dynamic fmu checker on the website.

#### Christian Legaard
* Moved to Leuven, Belgium for 1 semster of exchange.
* Continuing implementation of graphical editor for INTO-CPS application.

#### Corneliu Barbu

* Continue to work with PTC Academic to understand their offering and select what fits for us
* Netowrking with other users in EU / US on course offering, lab setup, etc.
